    "bio.p1": "Born in Berlin, Ana Fonell completed her acting and vocal training at the State University of Music in Frankfurt/Main and the Westphalian Drama School in Bochum. Even before her studies, she performed as a singer with her own musical settings of poems by Jacques Prévert as well as with international folk songs.",
    "bio.p2": "In addition to her theatrical work, her special love was poetry in connection with music. Over the years, she created a number of musical-literary productions with which she toured throughout Germany and abroad.",
    "bio.p3": "In Argentine tango, Ana Fonell has discovered a genre in which text and music, like in chanson, are of equal importance and where both popular and literary elements have found their expression.",
    "bio.p4": "The theatrical gesture of tango is as appealing as the variety and liveliness of its musical rhythms, which also invite new interpretations of traditional models.",
    "bio.p5": "Ana Fonell now lives on the island of Tenerife and would like to present her tango interpretations to a Spanish audience that is familiar with Latin America, including in its own folklore.",
